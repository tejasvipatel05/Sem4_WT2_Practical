      <span>About</span> Art Vista - Gallery of Digital artworks
    </h2>
    <p class="section__description">

      Art Vista - gallery of digital art is a platform with the aim to revolutionize the concept of an art gallery. The
      focus lies not only on establishing an appreciation for digital art and furthermore for its collection value,
      which is guaranteed by a limitation of the editions as well as by the certificate of authenticity, but also on
      supporting emerging artists, especially those who have been underrepresented at the art market so far.

      The gallery`s mission also includes making digital art accessible and creating a new experience of collecting art,
      especially for younger generations - so that, besides feeling joy for owning a contemporary artwork, they also
      feel great knowing that their purchase has supported a specific young talent.

      Art Vista - gallery of digital art functions as a hybrid gallery-model which does not only show the artworks
      online but also at exhibitions in various spaces and at art fairs. Presenting the works at exhibitions as well as
      at art fairs allows on the one hand a face-to-face contact between the team of the gallery and recipients or
      potential buyers and on the other hand an opportunity to working closely together with the artist. Because the
      main space of the gallery remains the online format, the possibility of staying flexible and trying out new ways
      of exhibiting art are provided. Furthermore, creating curated exhibitions includes writing about the artworks and
      therefore linking them to art theory and art history.
